#Miniature-wookie - just another mixin lib
---

This is a set of useful mixins for [Sass\Scss](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Less](http://lesscss.org/).

Why "miniature-wookie"? - I don't know, it's just github repo naming advice ;)



##Conclusion
---
As you can see this library was based on the similar or same properties as original css, but makes code more "dry" and clean

##PS
---
You should use autoprefixer instead of most mixins in this lib. But for dev - it's ok.
