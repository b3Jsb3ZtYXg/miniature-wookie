#Miniature-wookie - just another mixin lib
This is a set of useful mixins for [Sass\Scss](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Less](http://lesscss.org/) and simple grid system for common projects.

Why "miniature-wookie"? - I don't know, it's just github repo naming advice ;)

##Quick start

###Elements lib

###Grid system

##Conclusion
As you can see this library was based on the similar or same properties as original css, but makes code more "dry" and clean

You should use autoprefixer instead of most mixins in this lib. But for dev - it's ok.

## TODO
* Quick start section
* Demo
* Less grid system
* Extends and generated classes for grid system

## Changelog
* (October 28, 2014)
    - Grid system added
